# Learning Guidelines

## Core Principles

- **Be minimal**: Only add what genuinely helps future sessions
- **Avoid duplication**: Check for existing similar content before adding
- **Prefer specificity**: "Run `npm run dev` before e2e tests" beats "ensure services are running"
- **Focus on non-obvious**: Skip things Claude would naturally do; capture what surprised you

## Quality Checklist

Before adding a learning, verify:
- [ ] Not already documented elsewhere
- [ ] Specific enough to be actionable
- [ ] Would surprise a new developer
- [ ] Applies broadly (not one-time fix)
